# The function player_AI_choose(wd, t) chooses which move to use depending on the situation.
    # Here is the decision flow:
    # IF dodgeCMovesIfFree == True and the enemy has announced a cmove:
        ## IF I can kill enemy before being hit by defender's cmove
            ### IF I can kill it with fmove spam
                #### OUTCOME 1: fmove spam until dfdr dies
            ### ELIF I can kill it with cmove, + fmove spam:
                #### OUTCOME 2: cmove, then fmove spam until dfdr dies
        ## ELIF it's already in the dodge window
            ### OUTCOME 3: dodge (even if you have already dodged. dodging takes 500ms and the window is 700ms)
            ### it takes 1 or 2 dodges to do it. With 66% probability you need two dodges.
            ### If after your dodge is over, you are still in the dodge window, then you roll another dodge.
            ### If dodge_success_probability < threshhold, don't even bother dodging.
            ### threshhold = 40% for solo raids, 65% for team raids.
            ### dodge_success_probability is the probability of making a dodge if you are free to dodge.
            ### So the actual dodge probability is lower than dodge_success_probability,
            ### because sometimes you are busy during dodge time.
            ### dodge_success_probability is based on how quick the enemy's atk is (damageWindowStart):
            ### dodge_success_probability = 0.2 + ((1.0-0.2)/(3000-1800))*(dWS - 1800)
            ### the formula is approximate based on my own personal dodge success.
        ## ELIF I need to wait or I will miss my dodge AND it's past cmovereactiontime:
            ### IF I can still fit in an fmove
                #### OUTCOME 4: Use fmove
            #### ELSE
                #### OUTCOME 5: wait until dodge window begins + a short reaction time
        ## ELSE (aka if it's before cmovereactiontime):
            ### OUTCOME 6: just attack as usual
    # ELSE, I will attack:
        ## IF I do not have enough energy for a cmove:
            ### OUTCOME 7: use fmove
        ## ELIF fmove spam would kill before my cmove comes out,
            ### OUTCOME 8: fmove spam
        ## ELSE: I have enough energy for a cmove, so:
            ### OUTCOME 9: use cmove
        
        ##MAYBE TO ADD LATER: ELIF cmove would be very overkill and I have at least 35% HP remaining, use fmove
